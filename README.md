# Netflix Retrofit App üé¨

## üåü Overview
This Android app project fetches and displays popular and recent movies from The Movie Database (TMDb) using the Retrofit library for network requests. The app features a sleek, user-friendly interface with a RecyclerView for listing movies, and a detailed movie screen for more information about each film. The app is designed with a clean architecture, utilizing coroutines for asynchronous operations and Picasso for image loading.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure
The project is structured to efficiently fetch and display movie data from TMDb:

### Key Components

#### `MainActivity`
- **Handles the initialization and main UI of the app.**
- Fetches and displays a list of popular movies using a `RecyclerView` and a `GridLayoutManager`.
- Supports infinite scrolling to load more movies as the user reaches the bottom of the list.
- Shows the most recent movie in a prominent banner.

#### `DetailActivity`
- **Displays detailed information about a selected movie.**
- Fetches the movie details passed from `MainActivity` and loads the movie poster and title.

#### `FilmeAdapter`
- **An adapter for the `RecyclerView` to manage the movie items.**
- Uses `Picasso` to load movie posters into the list items.
- Handles item clicks to navigate to `DetailActivity` for more information.

#### `RetrofitService`
- **Manages network communication with TMDb API using Retrofit.**
- Configures `OkHttpClient` with timeout settings and an authentication interceptor.
- Defines the `TheMovieDBAPI` interface for making API requests.

#### `TheMovieDBAPI`
- **Interface that defines the API endpoints for TMDb.**
- Provides methods for fetching popular movies and the most recent movie.
